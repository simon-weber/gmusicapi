    Calls are made to music.google.com/music/services/<call name>

    Calls also need to send 'u' (I've only seen it =0) and 'xt' (=the same as the cookie) in the url. A sample url:

    	  https://music.google.com/music/services/search?u=0&xt=AM-WbXjYA_Y1LgZx_znahg9rOeIg3aDtWg:<long number>


    == Implemented Calls ==

    req - request
    res - response on a success

    addplaylist:
        req: {"title": "<name>"}
	res: {"id":"<new playlist id>","title":"<name>","success":true}

    addtoplaylist:
        req: {"playlistId":"<playlist to add to>","songIds":["<songs to add>"]}
	res: {"playlistId":"<same as above>","songIds":[{"playlistEntryId":"<new id>","songId":"<same as above>"}]}
	
    deleteplaylist:
        req: {"id": "<playlist to delete>"}
	res: {"deleteID": "<id>"}

    deletesong:
        delete from library:
           req: {"songIds": ["<id1>", "<id2>"], "entryIds":[""], "listId": "all"}	
	   res: {"listId":"all","deleteIds":["<id1>"]}

	delete from playlist:
	   same as from library, but given entryIds (from loadplaylist) and a listId.

    loadalltracks:
        Libraries can be big, so GM sends the tracks down in 'chunks'.
        Requests that don't complete the library have 'continuation tokens' required to get the next chunk.

        req: 
           first: {}
	   continuations: {"continuationToken":"<token>"}
        res:
           {"continuation": <True or False>,
	    "continuationToken": "<token if there is a next chunk>",
	    "differentialUpdate": <False - never seen True>,
	    "playlist": [ {<song 1>}, {<song 2>}... ],
	    "playlistID": "all",
	    "requestTime": <some time representation>
	    }

    loadplaylist:
        Loads the songs from a playlist.
	    req: {"id": "<playlist id>"}
	    res: {"continuation": False, //never seen true, but my playlists are small. likely works like loadalltracks
	    	  "playlist": [{<song 1>}, {<song 2>}], //songs also include an entryId 
		  "playlistId": "<id>", 
		  "unavailableTrackCount": <number>}

    modifyentries:
        Edits song metadata.

	There are a lot of things to be careful of when editing metadata. 
	Everything known is in protocol.py.WC_Protocol under Metadata Expectations.
	You should be safe if you stick to changing these keys:

	    rating to one of:
	        0 - no thumb
		1 - down thumb
		5 - up thumb

	    name - _don't_ use title. title is reset to whatever name is.

	    album
	    albumArtist
	    artist
	    composer
	    disc
	    genre
	    playCount
	    totalDiscs
	    totalTracks
	    track
	    year

        Also note that the server response is _not_ to be trusted. 
	Reload the entire library, then re-read tracks to see updates.

	req: {"entries":[ {<song 1>}, ...]}
	res: {"songs":[ {<your _exact_ request for song 1; _not_ what's on the server>}, ...],
	      "success":true}	    

    modifyplaylist:
        Changes the title of a playlist.

        req: {"playlistId": "<id>", "playlistName": "<title to change to>"}
	res: {} - note the lack of success entry here; this is normal.

    multidownload:
        Gets download links. Only tested with 1 id, but it likely supports multiple.

	req: {"songIds":[<id>"]}
	res: {"downloadCounts": {"<id>":<times it has been downloaded>},
	      "url":"<download url>"}

    play:
        Gets a url that holds a streamable copy of this song. Authentication is _not_ needed to stream this url.
	This call is unique in that it does not use /services. Its complete url is music.google.com/music/play
	In addition, it has an empty request body. The songid is passed in the querystring, along with u=0 and pt=e (not sure what pt signifies).

	req: <completely empty>
	res: {"url":"<url that holds audio file>"}

    search:
	req: {"q": "<query>"}
	res: {"results":{"artists":[<hits>],"albums":[<hits>],"songs":[<hits>]}}


    == Song Metadata Example ==
    (see protocol.WC_Protocol metadata expectations for more information)

    Song metadata is sent in dictionaries.

    All songs in my library have either 27 or 28 keys. Here's an example:

    {'comment': ''
     'rating': 0
     'lastPlayed': 1324954872637533L
     'disc': 1
     'composer': ''
     'year': 2009
     'id': '305a7b83-32fa-3a71-9a77-498dfce74aad'
     'album': 'Live on Earth'
     'title': 'The Car Song'
     'deleted': False
     'albumArtist': 'The Cat Empire'
     'type': 2
     'titleNorm': 'the car song'
     'track': 2
     'albumArtistNorm': 'the cat empire'
     'totalTracks': 0
     'beatsPerMinute': 0
     'genre': 'Alternative'
     'playCount': 0
     'creationDate': 1324614519429366L
     'name': 'The Car Song'
     'albumNorm': 'live on earth'
     'artist': 'The Cat Empire'
     'url': ''
     'totalDiscs': 2
     'durationMillis': 562000
     'artistNorm': 'the cat empire',

      (optional entry; exists if there is album art)
     'albumArtUrl': '//lh6.googleusercontent.com/<long identifier>'
     }
